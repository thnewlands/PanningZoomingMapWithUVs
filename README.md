# PanningZoomingMapWithUVs

Trying to solve this problem: https://answers.unity.com/questions/1902756/how-would-you-go-about-panning-and-zooming-using-t.html

- The issue with the rect approach is that the panning isn't consistent when zoomed in.
- The issue with the shader approach is that the mouse position isn't consistent when zoomed in.

You can replicate the issue in the thread by opening either the RectApproach scene or ShaderApproach scene in their respective folders.

I made this repository to make it easier for people to help out with this problem. Feel free to use any code you find in here for other projects but don't hold me liable! I intend to update it with a solution when it comes along.
